        San Francisco in the 1960s was the world capital of counterculture mind
        expansion, where LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) was the rocket to an
        unexplored universe of perception and aesthetics. The word psychedelic,
        a meld of the Greek psyche and delos, meaning mind- or soul-manifesting,
        was promoted by a pantheon of passionate scientists, scholars and
        thinkers such as Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey and Oswald Stanley. (Even the
        film icon Cary Grant used “therapeutic” hallucinogens.) They made LSD’s
        very existence define the time and place. Yet before San Francisco
        exploded with flower power, hippie culture, white rabbits and
        psychedelic art, the drug had a more nefarious role in the early 20th
        century’s plunge into mass manipulation. Nazi scientists were among the
        first to explore LSD’s psychopharmaceutical potential, followed by
        international drug companies and ultimately the U.S. government.
        Altering consciousness for opportunistic outcomes, LSD, psilocybin and
        other psychedelic compounds were tested to determine how they could be
        employed as neuro-medical-military weapons, including how soldiers on
        the battlefield would perform while in altered states of mind. In 1938
        the Swiss chemist Dr. Albert Hofmann was among the first to synthesize
        LSD into usable dosages, but even he didn’t realize its hallucinogenic
        properties until 1943. LSD was linked to the fate of the free world,
        when during the postwar years, the U.S. Joint Intelligence Objectives
        Agency in Europe launched Operation Paperclip, collaborating with former
        Nazi chemists led by Nobel Prize winner Richard Kuhn, who realized the
        power LSD could have in the interrogation of Soviet spies. Testing
        increased and it became a tool of counter-espionage. Arguably, this is
        when the LSD genie escaped its bottle and fled into the mainstream. In
        1960, the gurus of acid, Harvard professors Leary and Richard Alpert
        (known as Ram Dass), started the Harvard Psilocybin Project initially to
        address how the so-called “magic mushrooms” they had discovered in
        Mexico altered the course of human conscious and subconscious behaviors.
        Serious studies and papers began to appear in scholarly journals,
        notably the Psychedelic Review (1963–1971), by researchers and creatives
        interested in everything from the religious to the neuropharmaceutical
        to the artistic potential of the drug.But for those unfamiliar with the
        history, psychedelics seemed to have emerged fully formed—the public
        opened their eyes one day, and San Francisco was suddenly awash with
        split fountain colors and illegible lettering on rock posters and San
        Francisco Oracle covers. Indeed, artists like Victor Moscoso, Mouse
        Studios, Wes Wilson, Rick Griffin and others integrated, reinterpreted
        and invented new undulating graphic languages that were partly
        influenced by the hallucinogens they imbued. But their work also defined
        the essence of psychedelic art and design. More than the inner eye, the
        outer view—and cultural code—was what categorized and embodied the
        experience and continues to do so. Indian music is not necessarily what
        is heard while tripping, but its ethereal quality was adopted as the
        sound of psychedelics. There are many ways to hallucinate, but to
        suggest an acid trip, filmmakers used gauze on their lenses. Fashion
        designers took vintage clothes, added outrageously decorative and
        colorful eff ects, and it became the style of the times.
